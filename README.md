Hi — I'm Luke Dowling, a full stack web developer. This repository contains my personal portfolio site, built to showcase my projects, technical skills, and how I approach front-end and full-stack engineering problems.

## Features:

- Clean, component-driven React application using TypeScript for type safety.
- Fast development and optimized production builds with Vite.
- Modern UX: accessible, responsive design, dark/light themes and smooth page transitions.
- Easy to extend — clear folder structure, reusable components, and simple routing.
